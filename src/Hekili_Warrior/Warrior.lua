-- Hekili_Warrior/Warrior.lua
-- The Forever Warrior (Arms, Fury and Protection, one spec a talent tree: Hekili:NewClass): the Classic Warrior kit
-- with Forever's spell data (ranks, costs, cooldowns, cast times and durations from the Forever DB2 at build
-- 1.60.1.70338, wowdb, a cost of 100 there being 10 rage; the client is 1.60.1.70374, and its export wins where they
-- differ), Forever's Victory Rush and Spearing Strike, rage per hit for both hands, Bloodrage's and Anger Management's
-- rage over time, stances from the belief's Forms source, and the default priorities.
-- Talents: the 52 live nodes (a ForeverProbe export of the client, 1.60.1.70374, 2026-10-15; confirmed by the trait
-- walk of 2026-10-16, docs/research/2026-10-16-warrior-talent-dump.md: no Improved Shield Block, Improved Taunt or
-- Toughness, Defiance max 3, so Shield Block stays 7 s and Taunt 8 s). Only rank 1 of each
-- talent is in the Forever DB2, so a cost modifier is rank 1's value x the rank (Classic's own convention), floored
-- at 0; no cooldown or duration modifier is modelled but Improved Slam's (Slam). The in-game checkpoint compares the
-- costs (Snapshot cost= / read=).
-- Credits: Hekili (registration API and pack format); the abilities, auras and stance swap are ported
-- from Hekili's Classic profile (origin/classic:Classic/Warrior.lua); call shapes from
-- archive/TheWarWithin/WarriorArms.lua; the priorities are translated from wowsims/forever's APLs (MIT,
-- https://github.com/wowsims/forever; tools/wowsims/specs/warrior_*.lua).
-- The one- and two-hander rage rates as in Taco Dog Forever's Warrior pack
-- (src/TacoDogForever_Warrior/Warrior.lua:21-24).
